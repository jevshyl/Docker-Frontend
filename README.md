## How to start application

### Backend
#### Set docker up
```
docker run --name postgres_db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Java 18 (for Gradle)
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
#### Trouble Shooting
```
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "role_authority" does not exist
```
Simply restart the application. Hibernate sometimes does not initialize the tables fast enough and causes this error. Restarting the application fixes this
#### Run Backend
If running it for the first time go to the right side bar -> gradle -> Tasks -> application -> booRun.
Backend runs on: http://localhost:8080. 

### Frontend
Make sure that the Backend is running
#### Install and run Frontend
```
cd react_frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000

## Testing

### Cypress
#### Set up
First of all you have to install cypress. For that you'll need to use this command 
```
Yarn add cypress --save-dev
```
To open cypress you can use this:
```
Yarn cypress open
```
You will be redirected to Cypress, where you can choose your browser, where you'll get redirected once again.
#### Run tests
To run the cypress tests, you'll need to go to your Specs, which you'll find in the navbar on your left. Here you see all of our Tests:
- adminCannotAddElements
- userCreatesListElement
- userTriesToAddElementWithoutLogin

Click on one of those tests. It should run directly. If the test stops at the login and doesn't continue just restart the test. That should fix the problem.
#### Where to find tests
You can find our cypress test here:
- UEK223-OurSpace-Group-6-Frontend/cypress/e2e/

### Postman
* The collection of tests you can find in the backend here: \postman\OurSpace-tests.postman_collection.json
* The necessary environment variables for the collection you can find in the backend: \postman\OurSpace-tests.postman_environment.json
* A test run that has been carried out you can find in the backend: \postman\OurSpace-tests.postman_test_run.json

#### Import to Postman
- Open Postman
- Click "Import" â†’ "File"
